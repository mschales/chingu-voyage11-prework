# Responsive websites 
## - for Chingu Voyage 11 pre-work

## Overview

Websites were created for the Chingu Voyage 11 pre-work. Idea was to clone https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page196/conquer/ template, however some liberties were taken with responsive view and as a test case I used PX (pixel) values to fine-tune certain sections positions.
